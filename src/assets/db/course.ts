    { Title: 'CS575: Software Design', 
            Description: `When designing a significant software system, several design 
            decisions about the structural, architectural, and behavioral properties of 
            the system are made and documented. In this course, techniques and notations 
            are introduced for specifying these properties of software systems. Software 
            systems are studied at various levels of abstraction from architectures to 
            subsystem decompositions to module and class interfaces and dependencies.`,

    { Title: 'CS680: Foundations of CS', 
            Description: `Survey of basic mathematics concepts needed for the study of computer 
            science at the graduate level: induction, iteration, recursion; analysis of 
            program running time; graphs and trees; predicate logic; regular expressions, 
            Context Free Grammars, and Turing Machines.` ,

    { Title: 'CS720: Operating Systems', 
            Description: `This course we investigates the classical internal algorithms 
            and structures of operating systems: CPU scheduling, memory management, 
            and device management. Considers the unifying concept of the operating 
            system as a collection of cooperating sequential processes. 
            Topics include: file-systems, virtual memory, disk request scheduling, 
            concurrent processes, deadlocks, security and integrity.`,

            Description: `This course investigates interesting distributed systems concepts 
            with emphasis on distributed operating systems and distributed computer 
            architectures.   This course will be conducted using online class notes and 
            research papers that are relevant to the core course topics.  Course topics 
            include: distributed systems, distributed systems architectures, distributed 
            shared memory, cache coherence, distributed synchronization, distributed 
            file systems, fault tolerance, reliability and availability.`,

    { Title: 'CS281/2: Systems Architecture I/II', 
            Description: `PART 1: This course covers internal function and organization of digital 
            computers, including instruction set design, machine and assembly language, 
            computer arithmetic, ALU design, central processor organization and 
            implementation. Also covered are interpreters, assemblers, linkers, and loaders.
            PART 2: This course covers performance evaluation and benchmarking, pipelining, 
            memory hierarchy, superscalar processors, multiprocessors, and interfacing 
            processors and peripherals.`,

    { Title: 'CS451: Software Engineering', 
            Description: `Covers requirements specification, system modeling, formal methods, 
            architectural design, object-oriented design, programming for reliability, 
            user interface design, functional and structural testing, software reuse, 
            and configuration management.`,
